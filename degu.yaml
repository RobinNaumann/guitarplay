tagline: simple app to teach chords
about: |
  the app helps you to learn chords on the guitar. It uses the microphone to 
  listen to the sound of the guitar and gives you feedback on how well you 
  played the chord. Internally it uses a neural network to classify the sound. 
  This tended to sometimes crash the app. 
  If you have any issues, please let me know.
